ILONA v2

Design/Code: Tristan Greaves.

Mission Statement:
------------------

The original Ilona was my first major C project, and as such, was not programmed
exceptionally well. It did not make an efficient use of memory, due to arrays being
used most of the time, where linked lists would have been better.

Ilona was also having a problem on Unix systems, where processor usage would spiral
upwards.

I have decided to re-code Ilona from scratch. Not only will this allow me to
implement linked lists for more efficient use of memory, but I will be able to use
such systems to make Ilona inherently capable of running multiple bots.

Aims
----

	* Re-code Ilona to at least reach functionability of the previous version.
	* Much more efficient use of memory and machine resources.
	* Inherent support for multiple, multi-tasking bots with multiple servers.

29th June
---------

* Multiple bot/multiple server lists now in place.
* A bot successfully manages to connect to an IRC server port.
* Basic configuration file parsing, which looks like it will be able to be
  very powerful (reporting where errors are, and the like). Uses a look-up
  table for extra speed.
* Better layout in main() now - moving towards the config file being able to
  do everything, without "test" bits being set instead.

3rd July 1997
-------------

* All multiple bot/multiple server routines working. Bot connects to IRC server
  in completeness.
  
* Configuration and user file loading/parsing complete.  
  
* IRC command and Ilona command parsing implemented.

* HELP system implemented using external help file format.

* Commands in: HELP, QUIT, RAW, SHOWCHANUSERS

* Users added to ChanUser structs when they join, if not already present.

Source code lengths. :)

4th July 1997
-------------

* BUG FIX: Ilona no longer goes into an infinite loop if ChanUser structure
  is empty.
  
* OP and AUTOOP user file switches added. Ilona now auto-ops if required when
  someone joins the channel.

23rd September 1997
-------------------

* SHOWCOMMANDS: Displays all the commands that are available to a user,
  arranged by level.
  
  Need to:  What if no commands are available ??
  				Add FOR HELP TYPE.... bit on the end.

This project has been left alone for a long time. :)

It's difficult to know what I should do with it. Development might be better
off under a Linux environment, but I haven't finished the porting yet.

Or perhaps I should Java the entire thing ?
(Could get a very nice GUI etc that way... )
