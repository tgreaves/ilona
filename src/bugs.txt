 CURRENT BUGS IN ILONA
 ---------------------
 
 * On "Too Many Connections" errors, Ilona seems to continue connecting,
   regardless of max_retries.
   
 * No arguments passed to SHOWCHANUSERS results in gibberish. Need to
   terminate line properly.
  
 FIXED BUGS:
 ----------- 
 
 * Ilona goes into infinite loop if attempting to do a find_chanuser when
   the channel user list is empty.
