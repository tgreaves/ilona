Hi Tristan
> I'm not sure what you mean by a flexible argument parser. 

OK - atm, you can get whatever arguments were passed to Ilona using $arg -
i.e. usually a
nick. But it'd be nice if you could select each argument in turn using
$arg(0)... $arg(n), for example
or else (and possibly even better!) use the parseargs functionality so Ilona
commands can be
as flexible as AmigaDOS command argument parsing.

Look up ReadArgs under AmigaDOS reference, or see AmigaMail Volume 2, pages
ii-27 to ii-30.

That way, you can specify a template for a command, and parse it easily...

example:

Command: beer
Description: Ilona goes and pours the specified type of beer and takes it to
the specified nick.
                         If no type is given then the default (Stella) is
used.
Template: beer Nick/K/A Male/S Female/S Type/K
Usage: beer Fred Labatts 
                        "Ilona goes to the bar and pours a Labatts. She then
takes it to Fred, presenting it  on a silver tray."
               beer Fred Male
                        "Ilona goes to the bar and pours a Labatts. She then
takes it to Fred, presenting it  to him on a silver tray."
               beer Julie  Female Hooch
                        "Ilona goes to the bar and pours a Hooch. She then
takes it to Julie, presenting it  to her on a silver tray."

You see what I mean? By using ReadArgs, you don't have to do the work
yourself.

Hope this helps

Joel
