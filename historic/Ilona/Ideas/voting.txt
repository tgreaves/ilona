Actually, I think historically we have always had problems with UK uni 
people leaving pretty much the same day as the elections. I did write a 
mail to the UK school minister type thing to get them to adjust their 
schedule to fit #AmigaCafe, but they didn't take me seriously :|

It's not a problem for me; Anyone else have any wild objections?

:) The normal procedure for a vote on Henry is as follows (these are the 
messages I send to it)

CreateVote #AmigaCafe 10         (Create a vote called #AmigaCafe with max. 10

votes per voter)
AddCand #AmigaCafe Nick1 Nick2 Nick3 (Add them nicks to the candidate list)
OpenVote #AmigaCafe                 (Just to allow voting)
Vote #AmigaCafe Nick4 Nick13 Nick29  (Give votes to those nicks)

I guess #4 is the most important one to have identical, as that is the only 
one the users will use. Just a space separated list of nicks. Also, if a 
wrong nick is given or too many votes are attempted, Henry will discard the 
whole thing to give people a chance to review their errors and repent.

>That's it really. :)

Wohoo! ;)
