LogBot - History
----------------

                  * ALPHA TESTING - AUTHOR'S USE ONLY *

v0.1alpha [12th January 1997]
-----------------------------

* First alpha release.
* Main routines in place (Connections, parsing, channel/supervisor logging).
* External configuration file used.
* Developed on the Amiga.

KNOWN BUGS/PROBLEMS WITH THIS RELEASE:

* Bug: CTRL+C interrupt routine is bugged. Before connection, CTRL+C is
  trapped correctly. However, during a connection it results in a guru, and
  on most occasions a full system crash. I suspect this is due to my
  continous "read" requests, preventing stdio from receiving the break.
  (Note the "break" command has the same effect).

* Bug: Config parsing. Must check that SERVER, NICKNAME and CHANNEL are
  defined/set defaults. This is done already for PORT, but that is a simple
  integer check. Solution: Set NICKNAME[0]='' ? THen check to see if it
  is still =='' after parsing.

* Bug: Crashes while waiting for Ping Test from london.uk.eu.undernet.org.
  As yet, no explanation why this is happening.

* Bug: Log files are being set binary characters. I think this is related
  to the CTCP control code (re: PING).

* Problem: As a consequence, LogBot can only be shutdown remotely, via
  a QUIT IRC message! :-/

* Problem: Code not portable. Relies on Amiga exec.library routines to
  open bsdsocket.library. Have attempted to link with net.lib but for
  some reason an "Undefined stub" error appears. Does not occur with any of
  my other sources, and have not yet traced the problem. Suspect memory/
  compiler problem. Will get updates.

* Problem: For Amiga, icon-startup is allowed, but then it can't find
  the default configuration file. Possible solution: #IFDEF AMIGA, set
  configuraton file to LogBot:LogBot.config. Also disable LogBot's messaging
  to stdio.

* Idea: Under UNIX, shouldn't Logbot's default config be .logbotrc ?

v0.2alpha [16th January 1997]
-----------------------------

* Now requires AmiTCP v4 or above (Due to net.lib linking).

* Switched my TCP/IP stack to Miami, due to AmiTCP configuration problems.
  However, Miami is fully AmiTCP compatable.

* Amiga specific functions removed to make LogBot portable. Socket library
  functions achived via linking to net.lib. The date/time grabbing routines
  were causing the previous linking problem. 

* First compile/test under Linux. Source code modified to account for
  some function name differences between AmigaOS and Linux. LogBot appears
  to function correctly! :-)

* BUG FIX: CTRL+C / Breaking of LogBot now shuts down LogBot without a
  crash. Fixed with error checking code (See later).

* BUG FIX: LogBot no longer crashes if you pull the TCP/IP stack out from
  underneath its feet, disconnect the modem etc.

* LogBot now goes on "hold" until there is something waiting for it at
  the socket, so should take up less CPU time.

* Error checking added to server read/write calls. If there is an error,
  LogBot will shut down without processing garbage.

* Multiple LogBot's can be run with no problems, as different system and
  channel log files can be specified.

* The local shutdown is now "cleaner". If a server connection is in
  progress, it is severed "nicely" with the QUIT command.

* "PING received from server...." logging message removed, as server pings
  clog up the logfile too much!

* Added CTCP Support: ACTION, PING, VERSION. All CTCP *requests* are logged.

* LogBot can now rejoin a channel if it is kicked from it (optional). 

* Configuration:

  -  SYSTEM_LOG, CHANNEL_LOG, USERNAME, REALNAME, SERVER_PASSWORD and
     REJOIN_KICK options added.

  -  Configuration parser now checks that all required entries are defined
     before continuing. Missing definitions are reported.
 
  -  Separate default filenames for AMIGA and UNIX.
     ( Amiga = logbot.config    Unix = .logbotrc )

  -  Default configuration now found when starting from Amiga Workbench.

KNOWN BUGS/PROBLEMS WITH THIS RELEASE:

* Bug: Will not connect to london.uk.eu.undernet.org (Ping problems). Am
  not sure as yet why this is, despite improving the connection routines.

* Bug: *Some* binary codes are still making their way into the log-file.
  These are caused by IRC users sending graphical control codes, such as
  CTRL+B.

* Bug: REALNAME parameter can only take a single word...multiple words
  are ignored.

* Bug: Date/time routines not functioning due to net.lib bug.

v0.3alpha [22nd January 1997]
-----------------------------

* Now only requires AmiTCP v2 or above on Amiga.

* Bug in net.lib confirmed. Added extra OpenLibrary/CloseLibrary calls
  under AmigaOS (instead of using net.lib) to solve the problem.

* BUG FIX: Date/time stamping routines reimplemented!

* All message parsing routines moved to a central block. Previously, some
  were handled during the connection, which was resulting in code
  duplication. For efficiency and compatability, duplicated code was
  removed.

* Initial security functions implemented. The "supervisor" details are
  placed in the configuration file. When a supervisor-level command is
  sent to LogBot (eg. QUIT) the sender's details are checked against those
  in the configuration file. Both user ID and host are checked.

* The bot can now be made "invisible" on IRC. This should help to prevent
  "mass-user" messages cluttering up the log files.

* Now some response is given to user commands if the command is not
  recognised.

* Added Command Support: LOG, SAY.

* Added Error Support: 433 (Nickname in use).

* Added CTCP Support: TIME.

* Configuration:

  -  INVISIBLE, SYSOP_USER and SYSOP_HOST options added.

v1.0beta [23rd January 1997]
----------------------------

* Version number updated.
* Distributed to beta-testers for testing.

v1.1alpha [5th April 1997]
--------------------------

* Code tidied! Having just one file was getting a bit unwieldly. I have basically
  done the first step - functions have been put into sections, and fully
  prototyped (so things can be ordered a bit better). However, all compilation is
  handled from main.c -- different modules can't be compiled separately. This is
  the next thing to fix. :-)

* HTML logging system added. If user wants it, the log will be in a format
  suitable for viewing on the World Wide Web. Handles are made to show up
  more, making the log much easier to read.

* User definable HTML header added. If no HTML log-file exists, the
  header will be copied to it. This will allow the user full control
  over backdrops, colours, page name etc.

* "HTML protection" - It is possible for HTML codes to be sent to the
  channel, which will have an impact on the log! Thus there is now the
  option for HTML brackets (< >) to be removed prior to storage.

* Log-file archiving, preliminary system. At midnight, the log will be copied to
  a file "logfilename.date". After this, the current log file is
  restarted.

* Log-file date/time stamping. User can specify whether to stamp each
  entry with the time, or date&time.

* In archive mode, the user can ask for the join/part/messages stats to be
  appended to each archive.

* User files! Now there are three sorts of users: "Normal", Privileged, and
  "God". Privileged users basically have control over some of the logging
  features, but the more "dangerous" commands (such as quit) are left to
  the "God"users. The users are defined in an external file.

* Added Command Support: HELP, SHOWCOMMANDS, STATUS.

* Configuration:

  -  HTML_LOG, HTML_HEADER, HTML_PROTECT, LOG_STAMP, LOG_STATS and
     USERFILE options added.

v1.2 [12th April 1997]  First public release
--------------------------------------------

* Renamed as Ilona!

* Amiga AmigaGuide documentation written.

* Amiga GUI created, using Magic User Interface (MUI).

* Better GUI/Logging multi-tasking (1s idle time used).

* Server retrying added. If a server error occurs, LogBot will attempt to
  connect again, up to a limit specified by the user.

* Userfile: New field: OP. If OP is in this field, user will be autoopped
  when they join the channel. Also, they can use the OP command.

* Userfile: Can now be re-loaded/saved at any time.

* Userfile: New users can be added to it remotely via IRC. Also, OP and
  PRIV fields may be adjusted on-line. Users can be deleted.

* Registration... logbot.key file. Puts limits on number of users.
  Registration is currently free. Ilona_KM and Ilona_KR utilities written
  (For my personal use only). Unregistered limitations: Only three users
  in the user file.

* People can be kicked out of a channel (Optional kick message).
  (Bans can also be set, via banmask system.)

* BUG FIX: When launching from Workbench, configuration file now loaded
  correctly.

* BUG FIX: Erm, I now actually close logbot.config/userfile after using
  them. >;-)

* Added Command Support: ADDUSER, BAN, JOIN, KICK, PART, LOADUSERS, OP,
  REMUSER, SAVEUSERS, SETOP, SETPRIV, UNBAN, VIEWUSER

* Configuration:

  - MAX_CONNECTS option added.

v1.3 - 24th April 1997
----------------------

* BUG FIX: Ilona would guru nastily if HTML logging was enabled, and
  the specified HTML_HEADER didn't exist. Fixed.

* BUG FIX: REALNAME (in configuration file) could only cope with one
  word entries! Fixed.

* BUG FIX: SETPRIV didn't show in HELP command lists. Fixed.

* BUG FIX: User validation routine fixed to not crash under Linux
  (pointer error). 

* Default system/channel log names are no longer used. This allows users
  disable logging if required (Considering Ilona is growing beyond
  just logging now).

* Commands may now be issued in the channel, with a user-defined prefix.
  For example, +showcommands.

= User definable commands, courtesy of IlonaScript! :) Now an optional
  file, containing a list of commands, levels, and what they do.

* In registered version, user's name no longer appears if a CTCP VERSION
  or FINGER request is made. Only the registration code does. This allows
  Ilona users to remain anonymous on IRC, if they desire.

* Comment lines (begining with #) and blank lines may now be used in the
  user file, without affecting Ilona. Lost when user file saved.  (DON'T MENTION)

* Documentation changed to point out that Ilona *DOES* support host
  masking. It is done automatically, without wildcards being required.
  Please see "User File" section for details.

* Annoying autogreets! =) For each user in the user-file, you can specify
  a greet which will be sent when they join the channel, if you want.

* ARexx Support: Standard MUI Commmands documented.

* DCC Support - Initial stuff going in...

* CTCP Support: Adjusted to fit CTCP Standards.
  New Commands: CLIENTINFO, FINGER.

* Added Command Support: LOADCOMMANDS, ME, RAW, SETGREET

* Added Configuration Options: COMMAND_CHAR, COMMAND_FILE

v1.4 - xxth xx xx
-----------------

= BUG FIX: Commands sent via private, with the command character (e.g. !trout)
  were being ignored by Ilona. (Fixed).

= BUG FIX: Warning message to a user trying to use LOADCOMMANDS with no
  command file specified in the configuration was broken. (Fixed).

= BUG: ... flibble appearing on channel join with keyword??

= BUG: keyword not found in configuration.


 -- parsing.c file was destroyed at this point. :(
    Restored from v1.3

    Hence bug fixes above will have to be reimplemented.
