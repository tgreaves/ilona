ilona
=====

IRC bot for AmigaOS.

A little bit of history, considering that this dates back to 1997.

StormC was the software used to put it together.

Sub-directories are as follows:

Ilona
-----

As released on Aminet at the time.  This was pretty much my first foray into C programming and it shows!

Ilona_KeyMaker
--------------

Key generator for Ilona.  Some outstanding algorithms at play here (!)

Ilona_KeyReader
---------------

Simple program to allow testing of generated keys.

Ilona2
------

I started re-writing Ilona in C++.  The intention was to allow it to run multiple bots from within a single executable, using object-oriented practices.  

ilona3
------

Back to C for this one, so I imagine forked from the original Ilona.  Ability for multiple bots is there and the code was changed to be 'Linux friendly'.
